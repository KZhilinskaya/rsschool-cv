    </h2> 
    <p>My goal is not to waste my life. I want to develop and move only forward, not stand still. And of course I want to succeed in my career, I am ready to work hard for this, constantly improving my skills. Perhaps this is my strong point. I am very greedy for everything that surrounds me, especially for knowledge, new opportunities, and emotions.</p>

    <p> 
        I worked for 9 months in a bookmaker's office, where I was involved in bringing live broadcasts to the bookmaker's website. She also supervised the work of table sports players. After that, she worked as a barista in a coffee shop for two years. I gained skills in interacting with strangers and developed my communication skills. She also worked as a bartender in a nightclub.
